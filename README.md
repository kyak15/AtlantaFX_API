# AtlantaFX_API
The API is for one of my favorite shows, Atlanta. The project was built using FastAPI in python and was deployed on heroku. The API contains different
endpoints to send GET requests to get data from the show like:
- Seasons
- Episodes
- Cast
- Quotes

There is also a PUT request for adding new quotes from other characters into the show.
